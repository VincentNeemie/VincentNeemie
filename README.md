## 🧠 About Me

I specialize in solving complex, real-world problems with technology that blends **software engineering**, **hardware integration**, and **scientific reasoning**.

With deep experience in full-stack app development, AI/ML, embedded systems, and high-performance creative tools, I independently deliver solutions that scale — from idea to deployment. I’m fluent across layers of the stack, and equally comfortable designing robust backend infrastructure as I am soldering circuit boards or tuning neural networks.
